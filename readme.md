---

Hexagon is a microservices framework that doesn't follow the flock. It is written in [Kotlin] and
its purpose is to ease the building of services (Web applications, APIs or queue consumers) that run
inside a cloud platform.

It is meant to provide abstraction from underlying technologies to be able to change them with
minimum impact.

The goals of the project are:

1. Be simple to use: make it easy to develop user services (HTTP or message consumers) quickly. It
   is focused on making the usual tasks easy, rather than making a complex tool with a lot of
   features.
2. Make it easy to hack: allow the user to add extensions or change the framework itself. The code
   is meant to be simple for the users to understand it. Avoid having to read blogs, documentation
   or getting certified to use it efectively.

What are NOT project goals:

1. To be the fastest framework. Write the code fast and optimize only the critical parts. It is
   [not slow][benchmark] anyway, and it will be faster when it supports asynchronous non blocking
   operation.
2. Support all available technologies and tools: the spirit is to define simple interfaces for
   the framework's features, so users can implement integrations with different tools easily.
3. To be usable from Java. Hexagon is *Kotlin first*.

[Kotlin]: http://kotlinlang.org
[benchmark]: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks

## Quick Start

1. Configure [Kotlin] in [Gradle][Setup Gradle] or [Maven][Setup Maven].
2. Setup the [JCenter] repository (follow the link and click on the `Set me up!` button).
3. Add the dependency:

  * In [Gradle]. Import it inside `build.gradle`:

    ```groovy
    compile ("com.hexagonkt:server_jetty:0.21.2")
    ```

  * In [Maven]. Declare the dependency in `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.hexagonkt</groupId>
      <artifactId>server_jetty</artifactId>
      <version>0.21.2</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

4. Write the code in the `src/main/kotlin/Hello.kt` file:

    ```kotlin
    import com.hexagonkt.server.jetty.serve

    fun main(vararg args: String) {
        serve {
            get("/hello/{name}") { "Hello ${request["name"]}!" }
        }
    }
    ```

5. Run the service and view the results at: [http://localhost:2010/hello/world][Endpoint]

You can read more details in the [Services] guide.

[Gradle]: https://gradle.org
[Maven]: https://maven.apache.org
[Endpoint]: http://localhost:2010/hello/world

## Guides

* [Services]: explains how to create, build, test, package and run your services.
* [Configuration]: how to load service's configuration from different sources and data formats.
* [HTTP]: describes how to use HTTP routing and HTML templates for Web services.
* [Serialization]: details how to serialize/deserialize object instances using different formats.
* [Storage]: gives an overview of how to store data using different data stores.
* [Events]: how to support asynchronous communication with events through message brokers.
* [Scheduling]: explains how to execute tasks periodically using Cron expressions.
* [Templates]: describes how to render pages using template engines like [Pebble] or [kotlinx.html].
* [Testing]: explains how to the test Hexagon's services.

## Status

**DISCLAIMER**: The project status is beta. Use it at your own risk. There are some modules not
started yet (ie: metrics and remote configuration) and the API is subject to change any time prior
to release 1.0.

Performance is not the primary goal, but it is taken seriously. You can check performance numbers
in the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks][benchmark]

Tests, of course, are taken into account. This is the coverage grid:
